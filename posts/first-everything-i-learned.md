title: 'First Everything I Learned'

During this introductory week, I got the chance to get to know a bit about the family, environment and practices at Nearsoft. I would like to mention three subjects that were the core of the week.

Firstly, one part of the tasks this week was to get familiarized with tools and accounts. That is to say, to set up platforms such as my Outlook institutional account, Teams and Slack. This is a requisite, to later actually work. While trying to resolve these tasks, some issues did arise since I have been out of town, but with help from the team those were fortunately figured out. So, in this respect, I learned a bit of technicalities, how to use these platforms and that I can ask for help.

Secondly, I got to know the team in Encora as well as my Academy mates. I could see dynamics, how the environment at Encora takes place and understand the company’s values. It stood out to me how enthusiastic and willing to engage people were, to see an environment with bright people and where lots of freedom and creativity can take place.

Thirdly, I especially enjoyed the assigned readings regarding the topics of habits, connection, and apprenticeship patterns.

Regarding James Clear´s writing about habits, I was surprised by the introductory data that mentioned that habits account 40 percent of our behavior. To think that it such an important part of our lives, and that we strive so much to improve, but often not having the proper approach. That we often feel like wanting to be better, but don't know exactly how to achieve that. And then to be presented with a systematic and sustainable method to actually make a change, was an eye-opener.

I was also very much impressed by Brene Brown's TED talk. I understood the importance of being conscious of my process of connection and to let myself be vulnerable. I believe that to put into practice this mindset could help me not only to become a better professional, but also to become a better person. After watching the talk, I could not help but to feel very inspired and motivated, and more willing to engage in activities that will trigger these kinds of experiences, but now with a different perspective.

With respect to Ángel Pimentel´s talk about Apprenticeship Patterns. Some of the things that resonated a lot to me were: to expose my ignorance, then to confront it and fill in the gaps with knowledge in the most effective way; that it is important to have drawn my own map (doing it by myself) of who I want to become and start working in small steps and habits that will help me achieve that; to record what I learn, since I don't have right now a habit of writing; to reflect about how i work, and finally to learn to fail.

While most of this learning was a bit theoretical, there are things that I can start to do right now, from this very same day, and for the others to keep an open mind for when opportunities come up.
