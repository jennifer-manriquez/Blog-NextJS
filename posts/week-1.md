In this entry I want to share what I learned during Week 1 in the Nearsoft Academy program, where I have the opportunity to be in. I learned about what could be described as a mindset that will help me to better approach my projects and the way I work with software, in order to ensure that I perform good practices and that I am efficient. Also, learned new things related to an important technical tool, which is the linux shell.

I decided that I would organize the information using two means, writing a summary and also attaching my bullet point notes. The first one because I consider that it is a good idea that after having written down the important facts I can reflect on what they mean and reiterate the knowledge I can take from them. Also, it's part of the habit I would like to undertake to write better and more easily. The second, because I personally find it easier to write down, and would be a great asset to have this information in concise sentences for future reference. I'm sure that doing it this way will pay off.

**Profound life lessons**

What I can take from the Quora post regarding the most important life lessons from professor John Ousterhout, is that we should worry about making a program functional, with high quality, to not deviate into contingent details and to remember that we should look forward to making simple elegant programs. That we should be wary of our own biases, of trusting intuition too much, while it can help us, it is always important to check and rely on facts. That error will come out and that is smart to plan accordingly.

The complete list of summarized guidelines can be found here:

**Ideas are just a multiplier of execution** - Derek Sivers

**Autopilot**

One problem that we often experience in our fast-paced modern society is that we are too busy to notice our decisions. Autopilot Britain by Marks and Spencers brings to our attention our automatic behavior. That while acting in an ¨autopilot¨ mode makes our lives easier and prevents our brain from overloading, it also prevents us from living purposely and caring for what really matters. Having autopilot behaviour can cause poor decision making and low productivity, that is why it is important to take action and fight against it.

The first step is to identify the type that we experience and then take actions accordingly.

- Pleasers. Kindly say no and take care of yourself. Cancel the unnecessary.
- Pacers. Be instead of do. Start with the important. Remind to rest.
- Passengers (Overwhelmed with choices and information). Be conscious and stop getting carried along. Do something different every week. Prioritise to do list.

We need to be more intentional, stop making comparisons with perfection and remember that life is short special things aren’t for special occasions.

**X Workflow**

With this material, I learned about a methodology for improving the development process. The means to do it is by following a cycle called the General Process and is constituted of six phases as follows:

Discovery - Definition - Specification - Implementation - Analysis - ? - Discovery …

**Discovery  (Case-Manifestation-Solution)**

- Observation
- Data gathering (Logical simple explanations)
- Data Analysis (Prove ideas worng or right, use tools)
- Hypothesis generation (Taguchi diagrams: cause, time, order)
- Experimental design (Reliability of results)
- Test (Replicate your observations)

**Problem definition**

- Definition (Simple, understandable single sentence)
- Search for solutions (Research, brainstorm, model, prototype)

**Specification (Guide to build solution)**

- Problem (single one)
- Background
- Constraints
- Hypothesis (foundation of solution)
- Solution proposal
- Theory of op
- Black box (In and outs)
- Flow diagram (steps of execution)
- Functional and technical specification

**Implementation (Execution and error checking)**

- Data analysis
- Planning for future (Document what you did, what you think, new ventures)

This methodology also encourages people to keep a research journal to where the important observations can be addressed.

In general what you want to do is follow this methodology, but also to look at the company as a single team, recognize the value others provide, identify the stage of the problem and execute a plan properly.

**How to talk to people**

Regarding this topic, there was a reading named How to Talk to Anyone by Leil Lowndes, which talks about some tips and tactics that I can take into consideration before and while making social interactions. This has to do with the way you look at people, what your attitude is towards them, and how the information you are giving is received. 

We like to be listened to, and to be liked we need to listen.

Also, I got to attend an exposition of a self made manual of one of the teammates at Encora that really impressed me the most in this topic. I know I will at least apply some of the tips she mentioned, as I can sometimes have a difficult time when trying to meet people. Although I know everyone benefited from the talk, I love that for people like me it was very useful to have thought of how to approach people in different situations and when different levels of familiarity are involved. She talked about the importance of listening, being patient, reading the mood of others,  losing inhibition, making it personal, staying in touch, and telling people when you see something special in them.

Now it is up to me to put it into practice.

**Religion evolution and self transcendence**

The most powerful force for construction and destruction is human cooperation.

In his talk, Jonathan Haidt, talks about how war, and other extreme situations force us people to be brought together, and that it is through that cohesion that we can achieve a feeling of transcendence.

Emile Durkheim has a theory of Homoduplets which states that we have two states, the profane (individual) and the sacred (the united collective). When we find ourselves in the sacred we feel better humbler and uplifted, we lose ourselves and can self-transcend in this entity becomes more than the sum of its parts.

Being in this state is tremendously impactful, as Darwin explains in his Descent of Man, when groups have to compete the most cohesive groups win. The issue that arises is that sometimes the individual wants to take personal advantage and then the collective merits collapse. The way to solve the free-ride problem and achieve the best results is when we become aware that ultimately we are on the same boat.

**How progress really happens**

It is about change (revolutions, tech ). Tools for change have to do with, but are not the core of change. Rather the people and the risk they are willing to take

There is no change without power, and not until someone stakes their reputation to make something different

No change without power

Change (Why people resist it)

- Creates work
- Requires thinking, talk and listen
- Uncomfortable questions
- Embarrassment/death
- Traditions just because
- We don’t do that here

When we seek change

- Confront failure
- Witness others succeed trough other means
- Unhappy, bored
- Confidence

Book: The structure of Scientific Revolutions. Why do they happen when they happen? Not because convincing opponents, but new generation replaces old that dies.

Power:

- Committees advocate consensus and can lead towards mediocrity
- How much power is necessary to make a change happen

Tactics

- Power: What changes can you mandate
- Persuasion: Whose support you can earn
- Intuition: What can you anticipate

For individuals: Pilot (minimum viable), show success, find allies, ask for more resources, repeat, coup!

For managers: Pavlov people do what they're  rewarded for, hire for change, accept some ideas you don’t like, encourage interesting failures, only you can provide cover fire

**The linux shell**

Here are my notes from the Missing Semester course in the topic

---------------------------------------

```bash
missing:~$
```

missing-current working directory

~ - home

$ - you are not the root user

---------------------------------------

```bash
missing:~$ echo hello
```

execute the program echo with the argument hello

to provide an argument that contains spaces or other special characters use “ or “”

e.g., a directory named “My Photos” would be "My Photos" or escape just the relevant characters with \ (My\ Photos)

---------------------------------------

If the shell is asked to execute a command that doesn’t match one of its programming keywords, it consults an environment variable called $PATH that lists which directories the shell should search for programs when it is given a command:

which - tells you which file is being executed

We can also bypass $PATH entirely by giving the path to the file we want to execute.

```bash
missing:~$ echo $PATH

/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin

missing:~$ which echo

/bin/echo

missing:~$ /bin/echo $PATH

/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

-----------------------------------------------------------

Path - delimited list of directories

separated by / on Linux and macOS, and \ on Windows.

path / - is the “root” of the file system, under which all directories and files lie

path that starts with / is called an *absolute path*, any other is *relative path (to the current working directory),*

pwd see directory

cd change dir

In a path, . refers to the current directory, and .. to its parent directory:

ls - see what lives in a given directory (Unless a directory is given as its first argument)

-----------------------------------------------------------

"-" is a flag 

"-h" or --help will tell you options and what flags do

For example, ls --help tells us:

```bash
-l use a long listing format

missing:~$ ls -l /home

drwxr-xr-x 1 missing  users  4096 Jun 15  2019 missing
```

d at the beginning indicates -missing is a directory.

Then follow three groups of three characters (rwx).

"-" indicates that the given principal does not have the given permission

w - only owner can modify the missing dir

x - execute

r - read

mv - rename/ move file

r - read

cp - copy a file

mkdir - make a new dir

man- shows manual

-----------------------------------------------------------

programs read from here - Input stream

prints something - Output stream

redirection with < file  and > file to rewire to a file

>> to append to a file

| to “chain” programs

-----------------------------------------------------------

the “root” user is special, can modify (almost) everything, can break stuff

sudo - lets you do as  “super user”, or “root”

**Conclusion** 

In general, I learned that the best things I can do are being conscientious of why I do things in a certain way, it is about having good practices in the process of software development, landing ideas, practicing, executing and finding the ways to learn fast. That we can achieve more when united, how to make change and progress happen, how I can potentialize my creative thinking, how to learn faster.
